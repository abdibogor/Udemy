First of all we will start learning HVM L from the very beginning will cover a number of each TNL concepts
like each team tags page structure elements attributes WINX images and many others.
Each TNL concepts will then get down to learning CSSA and we'll cover all the basics.
Every developer should know like CSA syntax selectors fonts tables and etc. and every single lesson
will write code together and will analyze a number of code examples and launch each of them to see how
they work in our browsers.
This will give you unique experience and will help you to understand the behavior of HVM and siestas
