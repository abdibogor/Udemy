Question 1 :

Given an array of strings, if I want to find the largest string among them, which of the methods am I likely to use?


filter
reduce 

Question 2 :

The function
function sum() {
  return arguments.reduce(function(prev, curr) {return prev + curr;}, 0);
}
The call sum(2, 4, 6)

gives an error during execution
"arguments is not an array but an array like object. So the reduce function cannot be directly called."
