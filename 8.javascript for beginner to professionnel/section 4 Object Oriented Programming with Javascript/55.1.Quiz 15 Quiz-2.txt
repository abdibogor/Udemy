Question 1 :

Consider the following code:
function Circle(r) { 
this.area = function() {return Math.PI * r * r} 
}

What happens when the following statements are executed?
var x = Circle(2);
x.area();
method execution results in an erro

Question 2 :

Consider the following code:
function Circle(r) { 
this.area = function() {return Math.PI * r * r} 
}
What happens when the following statements are executed? 

var x = Circle(2);
area();
returns an area of about 12.57

Question 3
If we want to have a reverse method on the string object, e.g. "xyz".reverse() returns the reversed string "zyx", then we can write the reverse function as String.prototype.reverse = function() {//logic to reverse}
True

Question 4:
If we want to have a reverse method on the string object, e.g. "xyz".reverse() returns the reversed string "zyx", then we can write the reverse function as String.prototype.reverse = function() {//logic to reverse}
How can we access the string to be reversed from inside the function?
Using thet his keyword
