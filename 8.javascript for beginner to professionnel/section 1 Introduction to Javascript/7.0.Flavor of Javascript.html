		      Flavor of javascript
			 - Scripting language is a special type of programming language in which programs may be written as a set of statements which are then executed by what is known as an interpreter. 
			 - Functional (Javascript happens to support functional programming as well.)It means that functions in javascript are first class citizens of the language and may also be treated

as data or variables may hold functions as values.
			 - Objet Oriented (Javascript is also object oriented but the kind of object orientation is not class.)
Just like in Java or C-Sharp if you have word with those languages rather object orientation in javascript

		- dynamically typed(If you have worked with Java which is a statically typed language you must have noticed a few things
about variables)
      var message = "hello";
	  message = 4;
		  -->
		  
		  <!--
			 var x = 4;
			 var y = 6;
			 var z = x+y;
			 console.log(z);
		  -->
